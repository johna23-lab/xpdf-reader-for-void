xpdf: PDF viewer (click for a screenshot)
pdftotext: converts PDF to text
pdftops: converts PDF to PostScript
pdftoppm: converts PDF pages to netpbm (PPM/PGM/PBM) image files
pdftopng: converts PDF pages to PNG image files
pdftohtml: converts PDF to HTML
pdfinfo: extracts PDF metadata
pdfimages: extracts raw images from PDF files

XpdfReader, available from the download page, is a closed source version of the PDF viewer, which includes a few extra features not found in the open source xpdf viewer.

Cross-platform
All of the open source tools are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac.

The viewer (xpdf / XpdfReader) uses the Qt toolkit.

History
Xpdf was first released in 1995. It was written, and is still developed, by Derek Noonburg.
